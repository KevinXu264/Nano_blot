# To Do

### Add a check fo duplicated sample/probe/plot names

### Fix plot_data.csv, seems to be the most buggy right now because of the way it treats /n for a line or not

### Fix names in R script
I want it to add the negative probe to the plot name if a negative probe is used

## Write a manuscript + ReadMe

Describe limitations

### Add example datasets I'm gunna do this last so I can use it to test stuff.

ideally they would be small and approximately the same sequencing depth.
I'm regenrating data from WT and rrp6 directRNA sequencing.
