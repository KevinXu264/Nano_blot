# To Do

### Check strandedness

## Come up with a normalization technique

One simple idea would be to randomly sample reads from the larger data set until it is the size of the smaller dataset

THIS IS BREAKING MY BRAIN!? HOW DO I DO THIS?

STEP 1) For loop through plots and figure out what data is grouped together
STEP 2) For loop through data and find the lowest number of reads

Can I bootstrap it? Will that break things?

## Negative probes 

## Make multiplexing work

## Write a manuscript + ReadMe

Describe limitations

### Add example datasets I'm gunna do this last so I can use it to test stuff.

ideally they would be small and approximately the same sequencing depth.
I'm regenrating data from WT and rrp6 directRNA sequencing.
