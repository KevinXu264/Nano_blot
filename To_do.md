# To Do

### Make R script creates all plot types

Right now I think it only makes I type. I need to get example data for this.
I also want the R script to make a folder for each plot produced.
	I made a folder name I now need to generate the folder and save all the pngs
	into that folder
		I don't actually think I need to make a folder I think R can just save a file
		as the the full path with the new folder.

### Add example datasets

ideally they would be small and approximatly the same sequencing depth.

### Add amplification factor to plot names

### Add user FLAGs to the master script

Right now I only really need to add 1 for creating subset data and one for
making the plots.

### Make trailing args work for R script

### Add mutiplication factor to Master script

## Impossible probes 

## Make multiplexing work

## Come up with a normalization technique

One simple idea would be to randomly sample reads from the larger data set until it is the size of the smaller dataset

Can I bootstrap it? Will that break things?

## Write a manuscript

Describe limitations
