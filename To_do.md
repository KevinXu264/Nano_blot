# To Do

### Add example datasets

ideally they would be small and approximately the same sequencing depth.
I'm regenrating data from WT and rrp6 directRNA sequencing. 

### Allow the user to pass OPTAGS to the masterscript

### Clean up the outputs from the master script

## Impossible probes 

## Make multiplexing work

## Come up with a normalization technique

One simple idea would be to randomly sample reads from the larger data set until it is the size of the smaller dataset

Can I bootstrap it? Will that break things?

## Write a manuscript

Describe limitations
