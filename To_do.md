# To Do

### Make R script creates all plot types

Right now I think it only makes I type. I need to get 
example data for this.

### Add example datasets

### Add amplification factor to plot names

### Add user FLAGs to the master script

### Make trailing args work for R script

## Make multiplexing work

## Come up with a normalization technique

One simple idea would be to randomly sample reads from the larger data set until it is the size of the smaller dataset

Can I bootstrap it? Will that break things?
