# To Do

### Reflow masterscript so it has standard spacing conventions

## Come up with a normalization technique

One simple idea would be to randomly sample reads from the larger data set until it is the size of the smaller dataset

This is almost done. They way I'm making the files now has the problem of using a lot of RAM.

It would be cool to fix the RAM usage thing but otherwize this is done. 

## Negative probes 

## Make multiplexing work

## Clean temp data option

## Write a manuscript + ReadMe

Describe limitations

### Add example datasets I'm gunna do this last so I can use it to test stuff.

ideally they would be small and approximately the same sequencing depth.
I'm regenrating data from WT and rrp6 directRNA sequencing.
